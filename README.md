## LunaNet_coms_tradespace.m
This is a Communications Sub-System Tradespace looking at Frequency Band, Satellite, Altitude, Transmitter Power, Transmitter Antenna Gain, Received Antenna Diameter, Antenna Efficiency, and Bit Rate. The final output, usable_link_margins, gives an array with LM's that are above 3dB and their corresponding system architectures in the lunanet struct. Needs further bounding, Monte-Carlo,  Pareto-Fronts, etc. It also is not commented yet.
